# DSA Journey with Striver A2Z DSA Course

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey through Striver's A2Z DSA Course. Here, I document my progress and solutions to the DSA problems I solve daily.

## Repository Structure

- **Course Modules:** The repository is organized by modules/topics from the A2Z DSA course.
- **Problem Solutions:** Each topic contains problem solutions categorized by difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Code:** I aim to write clean and efficient code. Each solution will be implemented in C++ (or other languages as I progress) with proper comments and explanations.

## Progress Overview

| Topic            | Problems Solved |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Arrays           | 10/50           |
| Linked Lists     | 5/30            |
| Recursion        | 7/20            |
| Dynamic Programming | 3/40          |
| Graphs           | 2/25            |
| ...              | ...             |

This table is regularly updated as I solve more problems.
